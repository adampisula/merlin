# Merlin Desktop

This is the client desktop of my **magnum opus** - Merlin.

## Compilation
Actually I have no idea how to compile the program outside Netbeans IDE, but I don't think it's gonna be necessary.

## Running the program
In `dist` directory there's an executable JAR containing the program. To open it, type:
```
java -jar Merlin.jar
```


If you'd like to move the program (and you probably would) remember to move `lib` directory alongside the JAR.
